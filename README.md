# Data-Mining-Final-Project
In this project, we trained three machine learning models for handwritten Chinese character recognition from images where both the target and wrong characters are identified. Specifically, we are calling characters that are similar to but not identical to the target character
wrong. Additionally, among those characters that are wrongly classified, we found out why those characters are classified wrong. We also used identical models in another dataset for the purpose of analyzing how the computer sees characters as similar versus different.


### If you would like to replicate our project, datasets could be found using the following link:
#### Dataset: 
Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pascalbliem/handwritten-chinese-character-hanzi-datasets) provided by NLPR and CASIA
#### The first dataset: 
This contains pictures of five characters: 伍(wu), 伉(kang), 伏(fu), 伊(yi), and 伋(ji); the numbers of different handwritten version for each character are 595, 239, 602, 521, 240 respectively.

#### The second dataset: 
This contains pictures of five characters: 伍(wu), 乘(cheng), 个(ge), 上(shang), and 万(wan), the numbers of different handwritten version for each character are 595, 240, 521, 596, 245 respectively.
